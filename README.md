Some solvers that find area, pythagorean theorem, sine, cosine, and tangent, volume, and surface area. These should work but if they don't, then don't get mad at me. Finally, I'm not responsible if someone is caught using this in class as this is not for school purposes ;)

INSTRUCTIONS:
If something is being asked like yes or no for example, use 1 and 2 to answer them.
More Examples:
Input: Sine, Cosine, or Tangent? 
1 is Sine, 2 is Cosine, and 3 is Tangent

Input: What do you know: Hypotenuse or Apothem?
1 is Hypotenuse and 2 is Apothem

Everything uses a system like the ones above to ask questions.

BUGS:
If you get a number that is followed by a million 0's, don't panic. This happens sometimes
Examples: 
56.00000000000000001
278.9999999999999998

Sometimes it does this and I dont know why :(

MORE INFO:
Some stuff might not be very obvious like when it asks if you have a hypotenuse for a polygon. But if understand what it means, then you can basically get any answer you're looking for.
For the hypotenuse example: 
From the apothem to one of the sides, imagine that as a line. then imagine that is half the base. connect these 2 lines with another and you make a triangle. the hypotenuse that is being asked is the hypotenuse of this triangle
